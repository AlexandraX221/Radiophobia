# What is "Radiophobia"?

This is a new mobile horror game!
You start playing in a house with a Phantom
that is trying to kill you!
Your
character is experiencing severe
headaches and hallucinations at
the ominous sound of the Radio!
You have
several attempts to turn off the radio and
escape! 
But the Phantom is not sleeping and will turn on
Radio!

If you didn't manage to escape, then you
'd better hide and sit for a
while, because the Phantom will try
to kill you!
